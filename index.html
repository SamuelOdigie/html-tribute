      <p><strong>The brown bear</strong><em>(Ursus arctos)</em>is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America. In North America, the populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears, while the subspecies that inhabits the Kodiak Islands of Alaska is known as the Kodiak bear.</p>

    <p>The legs of Brown bear are strong with huge paws. Their claws are rather long on their front feet, allowing them to dig their dens as well as dig for food. The ears are relatively small and the face is concave while the head is large with powerful jaws. Brown bears have ability of standing and walking on their hind legs; they do so in order to determine location of a food source or to identify a threat. These animals have thick coat, varying in color from black to brown and blonde. The guard hair of these animals is longer, sometimes having white tip, which gives them grizzled appearance.</p>
